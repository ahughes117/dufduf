A duplicate finder, trying to be cross platform by being programmed in Java.

As I was a bit intoxicated after some nice drinks with my boss, I entered the house and my Xperia phone connected to my home WiFi. So, it re-uploaded all my pictures on the "Camera Uploads" on Dropbox, leaving me with a lot of duplicates that I was lazy enough to sort out.

I didn't find any app that suited my needs and my taste, so I decided to give it a shot and create my own.
